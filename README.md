# GetAllSecretsInFolder
The Really Generic script is designed to be a module to be imported into the Get_All_Secrets_In_Folder script. Really Generic includes the PS functions to get, delete, post or put data into the Rest API for BeyondInsight, Password Safe and Secrets Safe.

The Get_All_Secrets_In_Folder script is a script that will return all secrets in a Demo folder in Secrets Safe and output them as a table to the screen. This is just an example but provides a foundation to be used in real enviornments.
